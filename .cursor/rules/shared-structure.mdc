# Shared Structure Conventions

## Models

When creating a **model** (data type, DTO, entity shape):

- Put the file in **`shared/models/`** (e.g. `shared/models/user.model.ts`).
- Define an **interface** for the shape (e.g. `User`, `Order`, `ApiResponse<T>`).
- Use kebab-case for file names: `user.model.ts`, `order-item.model.ts`.

```typescript
// shared/models/user.model.ts
export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
}
```

## Directives and Shared Components

When adding **directives** or **shared components** (reusable across the app):

- Put them under the **`shared/`** folder.
- Use clear subfolders, e.g.:
  - `shared/directives/` for directives
  - `shared/components/` for shared UI components

```text
shared/
  models/
    user.model.ts
  directives/
    highlight.directive.ts
  components/
    button/
      button.component.ts
```

Do not place models in feature folders when they are reused; use `shared/models/` and add the interface there.
